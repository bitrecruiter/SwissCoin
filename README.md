Token-based hybrid currency implementation using HoboNickels & Proof-of-Burn

http://Acad√©mieSuisse.org

SwissCoin relies on Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, & Proof-of-Burn 

proof-of-work [coin A - PoW mined, unspent]

proof-of-stake [coin B - PoS minted, unspent]

proof-of-burn [coin C: any spent output - A or B coin changes to C / burnt state]

Users might exchange A/B coins in the meatspace with cold wallet tokens / active keys like Casascius coins or over the network via multisignature transaction / P2SH to preserve unspent A or B status - potentially serving to isolate A/B coin exchange into a separate 'offchain' system.
